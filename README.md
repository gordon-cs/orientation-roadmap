# Orientation Roadmap

An interactive web page to display forms that need to be completed by incoming freshmen prior to Orientation.

### Preliminary Goals:

Our aim is to begin with the web page elements, making sure that the HTML and CSS are not only functional, but also in line with the style of the Gordon 360 website. Once the page is complete, the next step will be integrating with the Jenzabar database to pull data and information on the status of student forms. The goal for the MVP is to have as many forms working as possible, with a goal deadline of late December 2017.
